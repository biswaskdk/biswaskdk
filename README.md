# 👋 Hi there, I'm Bishwash Khadka!

🎓 CS Student @ McNeese State University (Graduating May 2025)  
💡 Developer · Mentor · Gamer · Explorer  
🚀 Building real-world solutions with code, coffee, and curiosity

More than just a student, I'm a developer who thrives on **creative problem-solving**. Whether it's a full-stack web app, a hackathon sprint, or a boss fight coded in Godot, I bring energy, empathy, and execution to every line of code. I'm always looking to collaborate, learn, and ship something awesome. Let's innovate together!
